## Thank you for contributing to Spellbook!

The [docs](../spellbook/docs/) directory has been implemented to answer as many questions as possible. Please take the time to reference each `.md` file within this directory to understand how to efficiently contribute & why the repo is designed as it is ðŸª„

Example questions to be answered:
- What does each property in the [model config block](../spellbook/docs/models/model_config_block.md) mean?
- What is the [CI test](../spellbook/docs/ci_test/ci_test_overview.md) attached to PRs and how can I best utilize it?
- What are the Spellbook [best practices](../spellbook/docs/general/best_practices.md)?

Please navigate through the [docs](../spellbook/docs/) directory to find as much info as you can.

**Note**: happy to take PRs to improve the docs, let us know!
