I've checked that:

* [ ] the query produces the intened results
* [ ] the folder name matches the schema name
* [ ] the schema name exists in Dune
* [ ] the view name starts with `view_`
* [ ] the filename matches the defined view and ends with .sql
* [ ] each file has only one view defined  
* [ ] column names are `lowercase_snake_cased`
