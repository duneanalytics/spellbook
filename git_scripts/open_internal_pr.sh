### the name of your current branch.  To push to the upstream branch
### on the remote, use...
### Run `git branch --unset-upstream` from your terminal

### Print total arguments and their values
echo "Total Arguments:" $#
echo "All Arguments values:" $@

### Command arguments can be accessed as
echo "Github User->"  $1
echo "Branch name->" $2

### Add remote. If already added, expect an error "error: remote $1 already exists."
git remote add $1 https://github.com/$1/abstractions
### Fetch remote
