          The `secondary_order_type` is represented as an unsigned integer with the following possible values:
          - `0`: **None** - No secondary order type is applied.
          - `1`: **Adl (Auto-Deleveraging)** - Indicates that the order is associated with the Auto-Deleveraging mechanism. ADL is used to manage risk by automatically reducing or closing positions that are at risk of liquidation due to insufficient margin or other factors. This mechanism helps in maintaining the stability of the trading platform.
