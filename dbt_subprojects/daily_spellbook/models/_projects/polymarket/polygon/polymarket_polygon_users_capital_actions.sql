-- lots of edge cases here to ensure that we're just picking up on actual deposits and not internal transfers
-- this is a bit of a mess, but it works for now

-- we look for usdc.e and usdc transfers
-- usdc.e is the wrapped version of usdc on polygon polymarket runs on this
-- if you deposit using usdc, the UI will prompt you to wrap your USDC into USDC.e by signing a message
-- this will just use uniswap to swap your usdc for usdc.e, so we need to exclude 0xD36ec33c8bed5a9F7B6630855f1533455b98a418 as this is the uniswap pool
-- by ignoring the uniswap pool, but looking for USDC transfers, we can get a better read on funding sources
