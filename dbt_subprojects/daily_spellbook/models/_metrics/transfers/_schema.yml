      "The amount returned is the net received amount in a transaction. This gets to the heart of what was really transfered
      in a transaction, as the amounts that go from and back to a single address don't actually count as real transfers.
      For example, if I give you a dollar and then you give it back to me in a single transaction that should count as $0 
      because nothing was effectively transferred. If I give you two dollars and you give one back to me that should count as $1
      because one dollar was effectively transfered.

      The reason we filter where net_received is greater than 0 is because if you sum the negative net received (aka sent)
      with the positive net received (aka received) it adds up to 0 since the net sent should equal the net received. 
      For example, if I give you $1 that's -1 sent (from me) and +1 received (by you) which adds to 0. 
      This query counts the received to show that $1 was effectively transfered."
