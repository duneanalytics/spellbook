      short_description: |
          The dex.prices_block_solana table provides aggregated token price data at the block level, derived from decentralized exchange (DEX) trades in dex.trades_solana.
          It filters out tokens with less than $10,000 USD in overall trading volume.
          The final price for each token per block is determined by taking the median (50th percentile) of all qualifying trades, ensuring a robust representation of token prices across different DEX platforms.
