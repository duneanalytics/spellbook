        Gas Fees on Degen Chain (Arbitrum Orbit)
        
        Degen Chain is a Layer 3 blockchain built with Arbitrum Orbit technology, designed specifically 
        for the Degen community (primarily from Warpcast/Farcaster). It uses Base (an Ethereum Layer 2) 
        for transaction settlement and AnyTrust protocol for data availability, offering ultra-low 
        transaction fees and fast performance.
        
        As an Arbitrum Orbit chain, Degen's gas fee structure likely consists of several components:
        
        1. L3 Execution Fees: Fees paid to execute transactions on the Degen chain itself. This covers 
           the computational costs of running the chain's transactions and state changes.
        
        2. Data Availability Fees: Fees related to ensuring data is available through the AnyTrust protocol 
           and the Data Availability Committee (DAC).
        
        3. Settlement Fees: Costs associated with settling transactions on Base (the Layer 2 settlement layer).
        
        4. Priority Fees: Additional fees that may be charged during periods of network congestion to 
           prioritize transactions.
        
        Degen Chain uses DEGEN as its native gas token, which was previously airdropped to the Degen 
        community on Warpcast. The chain features a centralized sequencer for transaction ordering and 
        processing, which helps maintain its high performance and low fees.
        
        For users, the gas fees on Degen Chain are significantly lower than on Ethereum mainnet or even 
        many Layer 2 solutions, making it particularly suitable for frequent, small-value transactions 
        and interactions within the Degen ecosystem.
