        Gas Fees on Arbitrum Nova (AnyTrust)
        
        Arbitrum Nova is an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that uses AnyTrust protocol, a variant of Arbitrum's technology 
        that offers significantly lower fees than Arbitrum One, making it ideal for gaming and social applications.
        
        The AnyTrust model uses a Data Availability Committee (DAC) approach, where a permissioned set of validators
        is responsible for storing and providing access to transaction data. This reduces the amount of data that 
        needs to be stored and processed on Ethereum mainnet, resulting in lower gas fees.
        
        Nova's gas fee structure includes:
        
        1. L1 Data Costs: Fees paid to cover the cost of posting data to Ethereum. These are significantly lower
           than regular Arbitrum due to the DAC model, which only posts small proofs to L1 rather than all transaction data.
           Estimated to be approximately 20-25% of the total transaction fee.
        
        2. L2 Execution Costs: Fees paid for computation on the Nova chain itself, which uses a gas pricing mechanism
           similar to Arbitrum One but with a lower base fee (starting at 0.01 gwei).
           Constitutes about 75-80% of the total transaction fee.
        
        3. Fallback Mechanism: In case the DAC fails to make data available, Nova includes a fallback mechanism
           that leverages Ethereum's mainnet for data storage, which would increase fees but ensure system security.
        
        The AnyTrust protocol requires only two honest committee members for security, regardless of committee size,
        making it a more efficient but still secure alternative to standard optimistic rollups.
