    description: >
      ETHFlow enables the sale of Native ETH via CoW Protocol. This works essentially by placing an (onchain) order,
      through the ETHFlow contract (https://github.com/cowprotocol/ethflowcontract) sending native which then wraps
      the asset as an ERC20. The order is filled through this intermediary contract that uses ERC1271 signature
      verification to place the order on the user's behalf.
