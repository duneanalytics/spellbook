          The prices.day table provides historical price information for each token. The prices are calculated as the volume weighted average price at the day level from our dex.prices_block table.
          If there are no trades at a given interval, the previous price is used until a new trade occurs.
          It is recommended to use the contract_address to refer to a token rather than the token symbol as blockchains do not enforce unique token symbols.
