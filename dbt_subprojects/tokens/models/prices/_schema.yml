      short_description: |
          The prices.minute table provides historical price information for each token at minute-level granularity.
          This implementation uses a sparse hour interpolation approach, where hourly price data serves as anchor points
          and minute-level prices are forward-filled within each hour. This reduces noise and outliers compared to 
          direct minute-by-minute aggregation while maintaining good temporal resolution.

          The prices.solana_hour table provides historical price information for each token. The prices are calculated as the volume weighted average price at the hourly level from our dex_solana.prices_block table.
          If there are no trades at a given interval, the previous price is used until a new trade occurs.
          It is recommended to use the contract_address to refer to a token rather than the token symbol as blockchains do not enforce unique token symbols.
