## üîê Breakdown by Backing Type

| Backing Type | Transfers | Volume (USD) | # Stablecoins | % of Volume |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Fiat-backed** | 4,647,244 | $442.7B | 30 | **87.6%** |
| **Crypto-backed** | 218,987 | $39.9B | 42 | **7.9%** |
| **Hybrid** | 134,503 | $23.0B | 2 | **4.6%** |
| **Algorithmic** | 760 | $0.9M | 6 | **<0.01%** |
| **RWA-backed** | 10 | $0.4M | 1 | **<0.01%** |

### Distribution Analysis:
- **Fiat-backed stablecoins** absolutely dominate with 87.6% of volume
- Despite having **42 crypto-backed stablecoins**, they only capture 7.9% of volume
- **Algorithmic stablecoins** have minimal activity (likely due to past failures like UST)
- **Hybrid stablecoins** (mainly DAI) maintain significant volume at 4.6%

## üí° Model Performance Insights

### Data Quality
‚úÖ **High join rate**: 81 out of 95 stablecoins (85%) had active transfers  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive coverage**: All major stablecoins captured (USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.)  
‚úÖ **Volume calculation**: USD amounts properly calculated and aggregated  
‚úÖ **Metadata enrichment**: Backing, name, and denomination successfully joined  

### Query Performance
- Large joins processed efficiently (~5M transfers matched)
- Partitioning by `block_month` working correctly
- Incremental model structure validated

### Model Statistics
- **Filtering efficiency**: From 20.8M total transfers ‚Üí 5.0M stablecoin transfers (24%)
- **Average transfers per transaction**: 1.82 (some txs have multiple stablecoin transfers)
- **Coverage**: 81/95 stablecoins active = 85% utilization

## üéØ Next Steps for Production

1. **‚úÖ Model Structure Validated**
   - Filtering logic works correctly
   - Join with stablecoin list successful
   - All metadata columns populated

2. **üîÑ To Test with DBT**
   ```bash
   dbt run --select stablecoin_ethereum_transfers --vars '{"test_schema": "YOUR_TEST_SCHEMA"}'
   ```

3. **üìä Recommended Dashboards**
   - Daily stablecoin transfer volumes
   - Market share by stablecoin (USDC vs USDT dominance)
   - Backing type distribution over time
   - New stablecoin adoption tracking

4. **üöÄ Future Extensions**
   - Add models for other chains (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
   - Create cross-chain aggregation model
   - Add exchange flow analysis (identify DEX vs CEX transfers)
   - Create daily net transfer metrics

## üìà Sample Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Stablecoin Market Share
```sql
SELECT 
    symbol,
    SUM(amount_usd) / (SELECT SUM(amount_usd) FROM stablecoin_ethereum.transfers 
                       WHERE block_date >= DATE '2025-10-10') * 100 as market_share_pct
FROM stablecoin_ethereum.transfers
WHERE block_date >= DATE '2025-10-10'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY market_share_pct DESC;
```

### Use Case 2: Backing Type Trends
```sql
SELECT 
    block_date,
    backing,
    SUM(amount_usd) as daily_volume
FROM stablecoin_ethereum.transfers
WHERE block_date >= DATE '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 3 DESC;
```

### Use Case 3: New Stablecoin Adoption
```sql
SELECT 
    stablecoin_name,
    symbol,
    MIN(block_date) as first_transfer_date,
    COUNT(*) as total_transfers,
    SUM(amount_usd) as total_volume
FROM stablecoin_ethereum.transfers
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY first_transfer_date DESC;
```
