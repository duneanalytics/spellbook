  --				* Internal price of the token in OWL, ditacted by the solver
  --				* i.e Solver finds a solution saying WETH price is 210 OWL
  --		"owl_usd_price": OWL-USD
  --				* Best estimation price for OWL
  --				* Considers the external prices for all tokens to calculate the OWL-USD according to that token
  --				* For the tokens that the external price is known, selects the best price according to a defined token priority
  --				* As a fallback, if no token has an estimation, we assume the OWL cost a constant value --> 0.8$
  --				* i.e. OWL price according to DAI external source is 0.8$, according to WETH is 0.75$, then since DAI has more priority, we select 0.8$ as the price of OWL
  --		"token_usd_price_external":	TOKEN-USD
  --				* External price of the token in USD
  --				* It can be NULL, meaning, there's no price at that time (or price for the token at all)
  --				* i.e 250$ for WETH according to Binance
  --		"token_usd_price": OWL-USD
  --				* Is the best estimation we can give for the price in USD for the token
  --				* All the other prices are nice to know, but this one is the one we are really interested in. The other prices help us calculate this one
  --				* Calculates it using the price in OWL that reports the solver and our best estimate of OWL price in USD (owl_usd_price)
  --				* token_usd_price = token_owl_price * owl_usd_price
  --				* NOTE: Alternativelly, it could have been used the external token price if available, but it was prefered to use uniform OWL prices sol USD price are coherent with OWL prices (they keep the same proportion within the batch)
