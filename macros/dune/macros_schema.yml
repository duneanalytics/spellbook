  - name: databricks__create_table_as
    description: >
      Overrides databricks table macro to use an s3 bucket set by a dbt var set by an env variable.
      Macros do not allow access to env variables and therefore we must set use the dbt_project file
      to set the dbt var with the env var. If no env var is set, no location will be used. Env vars
      must be set by Dune employees but no change is needed for wizards
