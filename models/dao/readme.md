# DAO Spells

### Brief Background on DAOs

Decentralized Autonomous Organisations (DAOs) frame how humans use blockchain technology to coordinate decisions that pertain to community and capital.
They operate via decentrealized governance to allow a group of people to engage in open, democratic processes and make decisions. 
Using smart contracts and crypto-economic properties to create and enforce rules and interactions between parties, DAOs can be used to manage 
funds and treasuries, maintain and improve products like decentralized applications (dApps), invest in growth, etc.

In practice, any member of a DAO can make a **proposal** to suggest a modification, an improvement or a feature to a given project. 
If the proposal reaches a quorum, then all DAO members are asked to **vote** on the proposal to determine whether it should be accepted or refused.
Members of a DAO ususally refer to governance token holders (e.g., to be a member of the Uniswap DAO, you must hold $UNI tokens), and votes 
are proportional to the amount of tokens used to vote on a proposal (e.g., Bob holds 100 UNI tokens, and uses (locks in) 50 of its tokens to vote on 
a given proposal). 

### Tables:
- **dao.proposals:** This table is meant to give an overview and description of all proposals submitted and voted on across DAOs.
- Each row corresponds to a proposal ID, and provides a description of the proposal, its status, the total number of votes, etc...
- **dao.votes:** Vote events for any proposal across DAOs. Each row is a vote event, with the amount of tokens used to vote, whether the vote
- was for, against, or abstain, the voter address, etc..

### Projects:
- **Ethereum:** Bolded if Done or In-Progress
        - DAOs: **Uniswap**, **ENS**, **Gitcoin**, **AAVE**, **Compound**
