-- Uniswap v3 trades are derived from the Swap event emitted by the pool contract
-- The Swap event contains the amount of token0 and token1 that were bought and sold
-- The Swap event also contains the address of the pool contract
-- The pool address can be used to join with the UniswapV3Factory_evt_PoolCreated event
-- The UniswapV3Factory_evt_PoolCreated event contains the addresses of token0 and token1
-- The addresses of token0 and token1 can be used to join with the tokens_erc20 table
-- The tokens_erc20 table contains the symbol and decimals of token0 and token1
-- The symbol and decimals of token0 and token1 can be used to calculate the display amount of token0 and token1 that were bought and sold
-- The amount of token0 and token1 that were bought and sold can be used to calculate the amount of USD that was bought and sold
-- The amount of USD that was bought and sold can be used to calculate the price of token0 and token1
-- The prices.usd table contains the price of token0 and token1 and is joined using the contract_address of token0 and token1
-- The Swap event does not contain the address of the trader that bought and sold token0 and token1
-- The address of the trader that bought and sold token0 and token1 can be derived from the transaction that emitted the Swap event
-- The transaction that emitted the Swap event can be joined with the transactions table
-- The transactions table contains the address of the trader that bought and sold token0 and token1
-- The address of the trader that bought and sold token0 and token1 can be used to calculate the amount of USD that was bought and sold
