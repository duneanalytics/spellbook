# Optimism Contract Mapping
This repository contains all the source code for `contracts_optimism.contract_mapping` that you can use to join contract addresses on Optimism to pull our mapped project names in the `contract_project` field.

Mappings are derived from either mapping the contract deployer address to a project name `contracts_optimism.contract_creator_address_list`, reading from Dune's decoded contracts or manually overriding when the creator is not deterministic (i.e. the deployer creates contracts for multiple projects). We also use `contracts_optimism.project_name_mappings` to consolidate variations in project names. You can find the dependency graph generated by dbt [here](https://spellbook-docs.dune.com/#!/model/model.spellbook.contracts_optimism_contract_mapping).

## How To Contribute
1. Follow the format and add the creator address and contract project to `contracts_optimism_contract_creator_address_list.sql`
2. If you want to enforce consistent project name mapping other than Dune's decoded contract one, then add the name mapping to `contracts_optimism_project_name_mappings.sql`
3. Submit the pull request (PR) and tag [@MSilb7](https://github.com/MSilb7) or [@chuxinh](https://github.com/chuxinh) if there's any question
4. Once the PR is merged, check on Dune if your work is correctly reflected ðŸ”´âœ¨
